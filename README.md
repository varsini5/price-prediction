Shipping Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict shipping prices in the logistics industry using machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). It helps logistics providers and businesses estimate accurate shipping costs based on historical data and various shipment parameters.

Project Objectives
Predict shipping prices based on features like volume, dates, and routes.
Compare performance of different ML algorithms.
Provide a user-friendly web interface using Flask for uploading data and viewing predictions.
Visualize prediction results and model comparisons.
